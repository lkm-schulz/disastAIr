# disastAIr

**disastAIr** is a ML project whose focus is to classify disaster tweets using NLP. The project's name, *disastAIr*, is a play on words: the words disaster and AI have been combined to highlight the importance of both topics in the project.

Two models, Markov and BERT, were used for the disaster classification. The Markov model was built from scratch and the BERT model relied on a DistilBERT implementation that is smaller and faster.

The implementation, results, and benchmarking metrics of both models is described in a project report.
